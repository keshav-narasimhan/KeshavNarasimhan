# My Personal Website

This repository contains the code for my personal website. It is hosted on Github Pages, and can be accessed at https://keshav-narasimhan.github.io/KeshavNarasimhan . I will continue adding to this website as I advance in my academic and professional career. 

I created my website using React, a technology that I've always wanted to learn. I'm no professional web-developer, but I hope to become better and better at JavaScript and at creating beautiful websites. This website, I hope, will serve as an educational stepping stone for me on my route to becoming the best developer that I can be.
